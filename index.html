  	<h1> Table Mountain Loop Proposal </h1>
    <img src="images/TML.jpg" alt="Table Mountain Loop Route">
    <p><a href='https://ewn.co.za/2016/05/30/Cape-Town-buckling-under-pressure-of-urbanisation'>Urbanisation</a> is the largest threat to biodiversity in Cape Town. Since the seventeenth century, its unique positioning as a port city on the tip of Africa has resulted in a swelling urban population. As the city grows, its natural ecosystems are fragmented.</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>Dense urban growth leads to vehicle pollution</li>
    	<li>This pollution harms the surrounding natural environment</li>
    	<li>A train loop would reduce the need for vehicles</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Table Mountain Loop is a rapid rail service that would run around the base of Table Mountain. It consists of 36km of tracks and seven stations. Stations 1 through 4 are pre-existing Metrorail stations which would need to be upgraded to accommodate the Loop. Furthermore, three new stations (5 through 7) would be built as part of the project. One appeal of the Loop is that it integrates well into the current train and bus system. It can be accessed from one of the four existing Metrorail stations and MyCiti buses could adjust their routes to act as a feeder system for the Loop. </p>
